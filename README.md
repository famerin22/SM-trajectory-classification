# SM-trajectory-classification
This project develops a machine learning pipeline to automatically classify single-molecule trajectories as either “good” or “bad”. In experimental datasets, many trajectories are unusable due to noisy baselines, flat signals, or excessive dissociation events. Traditionally, identifying these bad trajectories requires time-consuming manual inspection. By extracting quantitative features and training classification models, this tool automates the filtering process, ensuring higher data quality and saving significant analysis time.
